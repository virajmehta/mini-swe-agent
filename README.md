<h1>The 100 line AI agent that solves GitHub issues</h1>

</div>

`nano-SWE-agent` offers an AI agent implemented in [100 lines of python](https://github.com/SWE-agent/nano-swe-agent/blob/main/nanoswea/agents/micro.py)!
Okay, maybe add another 100 lines total for a [minimal environment](https://github.com/SWE-agent/nano-swe-agent/blob/main/nanoswea/environments/local.py)
and [model config](https://github.com/SWE-agent/nano-swe-agent/blob/main/nanoswea/models/litellm_model.py) -- but that's it, and no fancy packages used!
This still packs a punch though: We resolve XX% of GitHub issues in the [SWE-bench verified benchmark](https://www.swebench.com/).
And then there's additional [power-ups](#powering-up) for you to mix!

- 🔥 Run instantly without installation: `pip install pipx && pipx run nano-swe-agent`
- ⚙️ Take full control & quickly prototype your own agent ideas
- 🏋 Lean assumptions-free baseline system made for reinforcement learning and finetuning
- 🐳 Trivial to deploy to sandboxed environments

The project builds on our experience building [SWE-agent](https://swe-agent.com), one of the earliest and most successful software engineering agents for research.

## 🔥 Try it without permanent installation <a target="fire"/>

```bash
export NSWEA_MODEL_NAME="claude-sonnet-4-20250514"  # your favorite model
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="xxx"  # API key for your model
pip install pipx && pipx run --spec git+ssh://git@github.com/SWE-agent/nano-swe-agent nano-swe-agent
```

## Install & experiment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SWE-agent/nano-swe-agent.git
cd nano-swe-agent
pip install -e .
```

This will expose `nswea` (local agent) and `nswea-gh` (run on github issues with docker as sandbox).
But you can also just run the executables as

```bash
python nanoswea/run/local.py
```

etc.

You can put your LM API keys in a `.env` at the repository root or make sure they're set in your shell.
You can also set your default configs like so:

```bash
NSWEA_LOCAL_CONFIG_PATH="/path/to/your/own/config"  # override the default config for nswea 
```

## Powering up <a target="powerup"/>

Everything in this package follows the following simple recipe:

1. Pick an [agent class](https://github.com/SWE-agent/nano-swe-agent/blob/main/nanoswea/agents) (what's the control flow you need?)
2. Pick an [environment class](https://github.com/SWE-agent/nano-swe-agent/blob/main/nanoswea/environments) (how should actions be executed?)
3. Pick a [model class](https://github.com/SWE-agent/nano-swe-agent/blob/main/nanoswea/models) (how is the LM queried?)
4. Bind them all together in a [run script](https://github.com/SWE-agent/nano-swe-agent/blob/main/nanoswea/run) (how to invoke the agent?), possibly taking a [config](https://github.com/SWE-agent/nano-swe-agent/blob/main/nanoswea/config)

We aim to keep all of these components very simple, but offer lots of choice between them -- enough to cover a broad range of
things that you might want to do.

## Contributing

We happily accept contributions!

<details>
<summary>Areas of help</summary>

- Support for more models (anything where `litellm` doesn't work out of the box)
- Documentation, examples, tutorials, etc.
- Support for more environments & deployments (e.g., run it as a github action, etc.)
- Take a look at the [issues](https://github.com/SWE-agent/nano-swe-agent/issues) and see if there's anything you'd like to work on!

<summary>Design & Architecture</summary>

- `nano-swe-agent` aims to stay minimalistic & hackable
- To extend features, we prefer to add a new version of the one of the four components above, rather than making the existing components more complex
- Components should be relatively self-contained, but if there are utilities that might be shared, add a `utils` folder (like [this one](https://github.com/SWE-agent/nano-swe-agent/tree/main/nanoswea/models/utils)). But keep it simple!
- If your component is a bit more specific, add it into an `extra` folder (like [this one](https://github.com/SWE-agent/nano-swe-agent/tree/main/nanoswea/run/extra))
- Our target audience is anyone who doesn't shy away from modifying a bit of code (especially a run script) to get what they want
- Therefore, not everything needs to be configurable with the config files, but it should be easy to use with a run script
- Many LMs write very verbose code -- please clean it up! Same goes for the tests. They should still be concise and readable.
- Please install `pre-commit` (`pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install`) and run it before committing. This will enforce our style guide.
