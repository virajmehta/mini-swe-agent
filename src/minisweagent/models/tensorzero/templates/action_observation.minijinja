<warning>
The output of your last command was too long.
Please try a different command that produces less output.
If you're looking at a file you can try use head, tail or sed to view a smaller number of lines selectively.
If you're using grep or find and it produced too much output, you can use a more selective search pattern.
If you really need to see something from the full command's output, you can redirect output to a file and then search in that file.
