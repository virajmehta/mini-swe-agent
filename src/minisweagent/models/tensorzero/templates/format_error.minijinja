Please always provide EXACTLY ONE action in triple backticks, found {{actions|length}} actions.
If you want to end the task, please issue the following command: `echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT`
without any other command.
Else, please format your response exactly as follows:

<response_example>
Here are some thoughts about why you want to perform the action.

```bash
<action>
```
</response_example>

Note: In rare cases, if you need to reference a similar format in your command, you might have
to proceed in two steps, first writing TRIPLEBACKTICKSBASH, then replacing them with ```bash.
