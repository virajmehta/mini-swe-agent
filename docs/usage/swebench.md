# SWE-bench

!!! abstract "Overview"

    * We provide two scripts to run on the [SWE-bench](https://www.swebench.com/) benchmark.
    * `mini-extra swebench` runs on all task instances in batch mode.
    * `mini-extra swebench-single` runs on a single task instance with interactivity (useful for debugging).
    * You can also take a look at the runscripts to figure out how to build your own batch processing pipeline.

## Usage

!!! warning "Docker container availability"

    The docker containers for Linux assume an x86 Linux architecture;
    you might not be able to run them on other architectures.

=== "Batch mode"

    ```bash
    mini-extra swebench --help
    # or
    python src/minisweagent/run/extra/swebench.py --help
    # Example:
    mini-extra swebench \
        --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514 \
        --subset verified \
        --split test \
        --workers 4
    ```

=== "Single instance (for debugging)"

    ```bash
    mini-extra swebench-single --help
    # or
    python src/minisweagent/run/extra/swebench_single.py --help
    # Example:
    mini-extra swebench-single \
        --subset verified \
        --split test \
        --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514 \
        -i sympy__sympy-15599
    # or
    mini-extra swebench-single \
        --subset verified \
        --split test \
        -m claude-sonnet-4-20250514 \
        -i 0  # instance index
    ```

!!! tip "Evaluating on SWE-bench"

    You can use the [sb-cli](https://www.swebench.com/sb-cli/) for extremely fast, cloud-based evaluations
    (and it's free!). After installing it and getting a token, simply run:

    ```bash
    sb-cli submit swe-bench_verified test --predictions_path preds.json --run_id some-id-for-your-run
    ```

    Typically you will have results within 20 minutes (this is not limited by how many instances you run,
    but by the slowest-to-evaluate instance in SWE-bench).


## FAQ

> Can I set global cost limits?

Yes, you can set global cost limits with the `MSWEA_GLOBAL_CALL_LIMIT` and `MSWEA_GLOBAL_COST_LIMIT` environment variables/global config.
See [configuration](../advanced/configuration.md) for more details.

> What happens to uncompleted tasks when I abort with KeyboardInterrupt?

Trajectories are only saved upon completion, so most likely, you can just rerun the script to complete the tasks next time.
However, you should still check for `KeyboardInterrupt` in `preds.json` in case some tasks were aborted but saved.

> Certain tasks are being stuck even though I deleted the trajectories.

The completed instances are inferred from `preds.json`. Remove the corresponding items from the file.

> How can I run on a different dataset?

As long as it follows the SWE-bench format, you can use `--subset /path/to/your/dataset` to run on a custom dataset.
The dataset needs to be loadable as `datasets.load_dataset(path, split=split)`.

> Some progress runners are stuck at 'initializing task' for a very long time

They might be pulling docker containers -- the run sshould start immediately the next time.

> I have some docker issues

Try running the docker command manually to see what's going on (it should be printed out in the console).
Confirm that it's running with `docker ps`, and that you can use `docker exec -it <container-id> ls` to get some output.
